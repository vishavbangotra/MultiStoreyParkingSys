## API Endpoints
##### To handle when a new car enters the parking area:-
A POST request to the https://localhost:8000/api/car/new/ to allocate a parking space to the car. And return the parking space of the car.
##### To handle when a car leaves the spot :-
A DELETE request is sent to https://localhost:8000/api/car/leave/pk/ to empty the parking space in the database.


## Problems that I faced :-
1. Choosing appropriate Data Structure for storing available parking slots. Finally chose MinHeap.
1. Choosing API authorization methods.
1. Bugs in implementing the logic.

## POSTMAN Collections are added in the Repo and the zip file.
